## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms with php

### System requirements
1. PHP 7.2 or higher (We have used PHP 7.3 for development)
2. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/Composer)

### Installation
* Clone the repository
* Make sure `PHP` and `composer` is installed in system
* Run `composer install` to install the dependencies

### Project Structure
* Our solutions are inside the [`src`](https://github.com/mkawsar/php-sorting/tree/master/src) directory
* Inside each problem directory we have 2 files `app.php` and `index.php`
* Here `app.php` contains the actual solution of the problem
* `index.php` is used to demonstrate the solution. Each `index.php` uses it's respective `app.php` for the demonstration of that problem

### Running the solutions
#### Bubble Sort

     php src/bubble/index.php
#### Hear Sort
    php src/heap/index.php
#### Insertion Sort
    php src/insertion/index.php
#### Merge Sort
